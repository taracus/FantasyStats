# FantasyStats
Premiere League Fantasy League Statistics builder.

The project PLFantasy is an windows exe that reads the leagueId from the app.config file and createse the javascript files needed for the Norrtan project to work properly.
Copy all the .js files created into the Norrtan directory and check the Index.html file in a browser for your personal league statistics.

PS. This has only been used on my own league which has 20 something teams, if there are more than one page of teams in your league this probably wont work.
